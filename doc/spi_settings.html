    <dt>MOSI<dd>the channel supplying the MOSI (Master-Out/Slave-In) signal.
    <dt>MISO<dd>the channel supplying the MISO (Master-In/Slave-Out) signal.
    <dt>/SS<dd>the channel supplying the negative-logic Slave-Select signal.
    <dt>Leading Bit<dd>
        <dl>
	<dt>MSB<dd>the most-significant bit of a byte is received earliest.
	<dt>LSB<dd>the least-significant bit of a byte is received earliest.
	</dl>
    <dt>Clock<dd>
        <dl>
	<dt>Leading Edge<dd>
	    <dl>
	        <dt>Rising<dd>the rising edge of an SCK pulse is the leading edge.
		<dt>Falling<dd>the falling edge of an SCK pulse is the leading edge.
	    </dl>
	<dt>Leading Edge Action<dd>
	    <dl>
	        <dt>Sample<dd>
		<dt>Setup<dd>
